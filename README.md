WireGuidedArrows
================

Add this plugin to your server to turn bows and arrows into wire-guided missiles,
similar to the [BGM-71 TOW](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BGM-71_TOW).  Arrows fired
will track continuously towards the block or entity you have targetted - in the
absense of either kind of target, they will simply continue a straight trajectory.

Future updates may include the following planned features:
* Restriction of wire-guided behavior to special, craftable wire-guided bows and arrows
* Restriction of wire-guided arrows' turning radius, making them easier to dodge
* Configurability (for *everything*)
